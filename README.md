## 🔧 Project Workflow

1. Data Collection

- Downloaded historical dataset from Kaggle
- Collected real-time data from USGS

2. Data Preprocessing

- Removed unnecessary columns
- Handled missing values
- Converted time into usable features (year, month, day)

3. Feature Engineering

- Extracted temporal features
- Converted categorical variables into numerical format

4. Model Training

- Used Random Forest Regressor
- Trained on Kaggle dataset

5. Model Evaluation

- Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Results:

- 📊 Kaggle MAE ≈ 0.23
- 🌍 USGS MAE ≈ 3.65

## 📉 Key Insight

The model performs well on historical data but shows higher error on real-time data due to:

- Feature mismatch
- Lack of engineered features in USGS dataset
- Differences in data distribution

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- Actual vs Predicted Magnitude Graph
- Error Distribution
- Feature Importance
- Global Earthquake Map 🌍

---

## 🌍 Geospatial Visualization

Earthquake locations were plotted on a world map using GeoPandas, with color indicating predicted magnitude.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Cannot predict exact future earthquakes
- Model depends heavily on feature quality
- Real-time data lacks advanced features

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add time-series models (LSTM)
- Improve feature engineering for real-time data
- Build classification model (High risk / Low risk)
- Create interactive maps

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to seismic data for magnitude prediction. While exact earthquake prediction remains a challenge, this approach provides valuable insights into earthquake patterns and risk analysis.
